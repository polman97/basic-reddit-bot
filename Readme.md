This is a basic reddit bot, powered by chatgpt. this was a side project for me, mainly to improve my python skills.

it selects a random post from a list of given subreddits and generates a response through chatgpt by sending the post title and a "modifier" (eg. generate a funny and relateable response to this reddit post).
some string parsing is done (like removing punctuation and capitalization) to make the bot seem more "humanlike"
